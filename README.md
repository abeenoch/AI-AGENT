# AI-AGENT
an ai agent tha helps with placing an order with drinks, built using python programming language, langraph and gemini api.
This AGENT is a conversational AI designed to assist users with placing orders at a virtual cafe. It leverages a state-based approach to manage the conversation flow and integrates tool calls to access and process menu information.
Key Features:
 * Natural Language Understanding: Understands and responds to user queries in natural language.
 * Menu-Driven Ordering: Guides users through the ordering process, providing options for drinks and modifiers.
 * Order Management: Tracks the user's order and allows for modifications and confirmation.
 * Tool Integration: Leverages tools to access and process menu information.
Technical Implementation:
 * LangChain: A framework for building language models and applications.
 * State Graph: A state machine-based approach to manage the conversation flow and track the order state, (state, node, edge).
 * LLM: A large language model to power the conversational capabilities of the agent.
 * Tools: Custom-defined tools to access and process menu information.
How to Use:
 * Initialize the Agent:
   * Create an instance of the Agent class, providing necessary configuration parameters.
 * Start the Conversation:
   * Initiate a conversation with the agent by providing a prompt or query.
 * Interact with the Agent:
   * The agent will respond to user input, asking questions, providing information, and guiding the user through the ordering process.
 * Place an Order:
   * The agent will confirm the order with the user and place it once confirmed.
 * End the Conversation:
   * The conversation can be ended by the user or when the order is placed.
Future Improvements:
 * Enhanced Natural Language Understanding: Improve the LLM's ability to understand complex user queries and requests.
 * Expanded Menu and Customization Options: Add more menu items and customization options to the tool.
 * Integration with Payment Systems: Allow users to pay for orders directly through the agent.
 * Error Handling and Recovery: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
 * Personalization: Customize the agent's responses based on user preferences and past interactions.
